## Not Practical. Not Efficient. Shouldn't exist

Ever stared at a crisp, high-def video and thought,

> “You know what this needs? Way less clarity and way more dollar signs.”

No? Too bad.  

this bad boy chews up videos and spits out keyboard diarrhea that vaguely resembles motion pictures, at a **WHOPPING 10fps** (who needs like resolution and stuff)

## 🌟 Features That’ll Make Your Grandma Ask If You’re Okay

- 🔁 Real-Time Conversion   – Because waiting is for cowards
- 🧱 Character-Based Frames – Who needs pixels when you have punctuation?
- 🧠 Browser-Based Playback – I know y'all arent booting up a terminal
- 💾 FFmpeg Wizardry        – Yeah I used this (still can't wrap my head around this)

## 🚀 Getting Started (Why are you still here?)

### Prerequisites

- Go (the programming language)
- FFmpeg (for all your video manipulation needs)
- A video file (preferably something with good contrast, unless you enjoy ASCII abstract art)
- A sense of humor (required for appreciating the results)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository like it's the last repo on GitHub
git clone https://github.com/mush1e/ASCII-Video-Gen.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ASCII-Video-Gen

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Start the server and question your life choices
go run ./cmd/video2ascii/main.go
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and watch your GPU cry for help!

## 🎮 How to Use (don't you have something better to do?)

1. Upload a video
2. Click "Convert to ASCII"
3. Wait patiently while questioning your decision
4. Behold! Your video is now a bunch of symbols!
5. Try to recognize what you're looking at
6. Show your friends and pretend this was exactly what you intended

## 🧠 Advanced Tips (Bro pls leave)

- High contrast videos work best (High contrast = ✨ clearer garbage ✨)
- If you can't recognize the output, well.... it's art you won't get it
- Tell people it took months to code when it really took one very depressing and lonely evening

## 📊 Technical Mumbo Jumbo

This project utilizes state-of-the-art technology (math and shi) to convert pixel data into ASCII characters with a revolutionary technique known as "divisio". We leverage the cutting-edge FFmpeg library to process video frames, which are then transformed into characters using our proprietary "character density algorithm" (more colour = fatter character).
